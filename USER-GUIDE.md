# 📘 Life Dimensions Goal Tracker - User Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the Life Dimensions Goal Tracker! This guide will help you navigate and make the most of this tool to transform your life across six key dimensions.

## 💡 Core Concept

The Life Dimensions Goal Tracker is based on a powerful concept: visualizing your one-year journey across six life dimensions using a grid system. By thinking of your goals in past tense (as if already accomplished), you engage your brain's visualization powers to help make those goals reality.

## 🧭 Navigation

### The Grid Overview

The main interface is a grid with:
- **Rows**: 6 life dimensions (family, health, wealth, self-realization, friends, leisure)
- **Columns**: 12 months of the year, plus headers and annual goals
- **Cells**: Each intersection where you can place milestones

## 🎯 Working with Milestones

### Adding a Milestone

1. **Click on any empty cell** in the grid where you want to add a milestone
2. In the sidebar that appears, **enter your milestone description in past tense** (e.g., "Ran a half marathon" rather than "Run a half marathon")
3. **Click the + button** to add the milestone to your grid

### Managing Milestones

- **Complete a milestone**: Click on the milestone to mark it as complete (a checkmark will appear)
- **Edit a milestone**: Hover over a milestone and click the pencil icon
- **Delete a milestone**: Hover over a milestone and click the trash icon

> 💡 **Tip**: Writing milestones in past tense helps your brain visualize success!

## 🏆 Working with Annual Goals

Annual goals represent your key objectives for each life dimension for the entire year.

### Adding an Annual Goal

1. **Click the "Add Goal" button** in the goals column for any dimension
2. In the modal that appears, **enter your goal description**
3. **Click "Add Goal"** to save

### Managing Goals

- **Complete a goal**: Click on the circle next to the goal to mark it as complete
- **Delete a goal**: Hover over a goal and click the trash icon

> 💡 **Tip**: Limit yourself to 2-3 key goals per dimension for better focus

## 📊 Tracking Progress

The Life Dimensions Goal Tracker automatically calculates your progress:

- **Overall Progress**: Visible at the top of the screen, this shows the percentage of all milestones completed
- **Visual Progress**: Cells with completed milestones will have checkmarks to visually indicate progress

## 💫 Best Practices

1. **Start with Annual Goals**: Define 1-3 goals for each dimension before setting monthly milestones
2. **Be Specific**: Create clearly defined milestones that are measurable
3. **Balance Your Dimensions**: Try to make progress across all dimensions, not just 1-2
4. **Review Weekly**: Schedule a weekly review to update progress and adjust milestones as needed
5. **Write in Past Tense**: Frame all milestones as if you've already accomplished them
6. **Limit Milestones**: Keep to a maximum of 3 milestones per month per dimension to stay focused

## 🔄 Monthly Workflow

For best results, follow this monthly workflow:

1. At the **start of each month**, review upcoming milestones
2. **Weekly**, mark completed milestones and adjust as needed
3. At **month end**, review all milestones and celebrate successes
4. **Quarterly**, review your annual goals and adjust if necessary
