### Core Components

1. **Grid Component (`Grid.tsx`):**
   - Main visualization showing the 6√ó12 grid (dimensions √ó months)
   - Displays milestones as cards within each cell
   - Manages interactions (add, edit, delete, complete milestones)
   - Shows dimension-specific goals in the rightmost column

2. **Sidebar Component (`Sidebar.tsx`):**
   - Handles adding and editing milestones
   - Displays existing milestones for a selected cell
   - Allows selection of dimension and month

3. **GoalModal Component (`GoalModal.tsx`):**

### Data Models

Defined in `types.ts`:

- **Dimension:** Six life areas ('family', 'health', 'wealth', 'self-realization', 'friends', 'leisure')
- **Milestone:** Achievements tied to specific dimensions and months
- **Goal:** Annual objectives for each dimension
- **DimensionConfig:** Visual configuration for each dimension (colors, icons)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### State Management

- React's `useState` hooks manage the application state
- Core state objects:
  - `milestones[]`: Array of all milestones across dimensions and months
  - `goals[]`: Array of annual goals for each dimension
  - UI state for modals and sidebars

### User Interactions

1. **Adding Milestones:**
   - Click on a grid cell to open the sidebar
   - Enter milestone description in past tense
   - Milestone is added to the selected cell

2. **Completing Milestones:**
   - Click on a milestone to toggle completion status
   - Visual checkmarks indicate completed items

3. **Managing Goals:**
   - Add annual goals via the "Add Goal" button in each dimension row
   - Toggle goal completion status
   - Delete goals when no longer relevant

### Progress Calculation

Overall progress is calculated by determining the percentage of completed milestones across all dimensions and months.
